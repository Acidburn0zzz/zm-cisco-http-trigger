Zoneminder Cisco HTTP POST Trigger
Created by: Nathan Tremmel
This project is meant to use Cisco's built in XML HTTP POST feature to create triggers for motion detection and alarm I/O ports without the need for any custom code per device or user using PHP.

This will use Zoneminder's zmtrigger.pl socket connection feature to send the command to record                   
                                                                                                                                                         
I will be testing with Cisco CIVS-IPC-2621V and CIVS-IPC-6400
