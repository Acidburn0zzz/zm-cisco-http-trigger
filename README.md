Zoneminder Cisco HTTP POST Trigger
This project is meant to use Cisco's built in XML HTTP POST feature to create triggers for motion detection and alarm I/O ports.                         
                                                                                                                                                         
I will be testing with Cisco CIVS-IPC-2621V and CIVS-IPC-6400
